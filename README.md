# BANK-ACCOUNT-TRANSACTIONS
This program receives customer information from the user, checks the account balance and transfers money. When the account balance is not sufficient or the customer's name or surname containing invalid characters is entered, errors are displayed as a message and the program is terminated. Otherwise, the final account balance is calculated and printed on the screen.
